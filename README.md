# CS-350 Emerging Sys Arch & Tech

# 1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

By utilizing UART, I2C, Timer, and GPIO peripherals that are built into the TI board. I was able to implement a working thermostat that deals with several types of 
input and output. This involved coding the board's functionality properly, where temperature changes to the peripherals would be indicated by an LED turning on and 
values changing, ultimately simulating the working thermostat. 

# 2. What did you do particularly well?

I believe my mental mindset throughout this project is what I did the best in. With me being weeks behind the rest of my class due to faulty equipment, I was able to 
produce functional code promptly.  

# 3. Where could you improve?

I believe seeking guidance sooner throughout this project is something on which I could improve. I tend to try to complete everything on my own, not realizing I have help 
available if needed. This may have saved me countless hours of troubleshooting and attempting different methods of solving my problems.

# 4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Because I started my project after my peers, a lot of their input throughout module six discussion week benefited a lot. Seeing the questions of what everyone was struggling 
with and reading the answers provided to those questions helped me a lot when preparing for my project. Also, the header files within the project gave me a lot of guidance on 
the functionality of the majority of things within the project.
